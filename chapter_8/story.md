# Radish's Rough Morning


It’s been a pretty rough morning for poor radish guys.

At first, radish and turnip got up, pretty excited for breakfast.

To be sure we get our protein in, we decided to get some Greek yogurt as well.

But if you notice, turnip isn’t look too hot. Kinda staring at the floor.

While trying to get the yogurt ready he passed out.

Radish, very concerned went to check on him.

We think turnip has the bunny flu. So radish tucked him in, and gave him a gentle forehead kiss.

Then espresso. She kinda had to make it up though as the espresso bunnies were up too late last night.

However, seasoning a roast is a lot of work for a single bunny and she was pretty tired.

So I offered to help make the rest of the pancakes.Even made her two.

After breakfast, it didn’t feel right to leave Radish by herself, so I brought her to the office to do some work. Poor little bunny was so tired she feel asleep in my head phones.

That said, we were both struggling, so we made another latte.
