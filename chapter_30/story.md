# A Motorcycle Adventure

This morning Shanny and I went on adventures. First up! The farmers market. I was planning on riding while Shanny drove. 
But as I was gearing up I felt a small tug at my pants.
Bubbles, as you may remember wanted to take the bike for the donut adventure, and was drooling over the bike last week when she got the tubs out of the car.
Shanny said she could go for a ride, only if she had a seat belt.
