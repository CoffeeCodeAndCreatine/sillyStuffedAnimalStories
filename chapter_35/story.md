# Retail Therapy For Espresso

Espresso is still pretty upset with the loss of the new machine. So for a little retail therapy I ordered him a coffee sample from Onyx.

As onyx is typically black, Espresso decided we should start with the black bag.

We decided to go chemex today. Dialing in new beans, especially fresh ones can be fussy.

With the week of meetings we have had, Espresso decided this mug was the most appropriate.
