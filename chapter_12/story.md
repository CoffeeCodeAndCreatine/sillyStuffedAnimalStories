# To Be An Office Bunny

As luck would have it, the internet went out today. Monday is the first return to office day, however as we have no internet, I figured I'd go into today.
I asked the bunnies if any wanted to be office bunnies, Carmel and Smartie said that sounded pretty cool.
So they started packing, first up was the monitor.

Carmel even did his best to make office coffee. 
Which was pretty terrible, but I can't blame this one on the bunny.

After a while it was time to go home, so I put the bunnies in the corner, and told them I would see them Monday.

Right as I was about to leave, I heard the saddest bunny whimper.
Turns out, Carmel and Smartie were have some major second thoughts about being office bunnies.
There are no bunny friends, no blankets, and no bunny snacks.

I asked them if they would rather go home, and without a second thought, they jumped in the bag.
I did tell them I have a hot date this evening, so they would have to be on their best behavior.

Bunnies said "you wont even know we are here"

We pulled up to Jack Allen's to meet up with Shanny. Shanny was enjoying a table outside, and said if the bunnies were good, they could sit on the table. Shanny even offered to order them a snack.

Acron is consulting the menu.

The bunnies got a drink, turns out offices can be quite stressful.

After a lovely dinner, we all made it home. Smartie and Carmel snuggled into a blanket and decided being a home office bunny is far better than being a work office bunny.
