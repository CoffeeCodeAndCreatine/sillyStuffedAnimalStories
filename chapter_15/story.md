The bunnies wanted to snuggle with Sidney, so Melon and Smarties crawled on top of him. Sidney was not too amused. However the bunnies decided Sidney was quite soft and would be a great cuddle buddy!

Sid however, did not agree. He said bunnies fidget too much.

Sidney kicked out all the bunnies but Smartie, who was the only bunny who could stay still.
