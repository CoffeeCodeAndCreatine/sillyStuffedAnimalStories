Today we are getting the second desk set up for the new computer. First we need to center the monitor.

We plan to run power strips behind the desk.

Got the power set up, and the desk back. But now we have a mess. Time for cable management?

Radish and Turnip called Smartie and Carmel to help with the cables. They, after all, are the home office bunnies.
