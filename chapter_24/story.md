Today was the first happy hour in quite a while, the bunnies who wanted to make a good first impression, decided it was best to clean the house.
First, peanut got started with the guest bathroom.

And you can't leave a blanket all over the couch, so they folded that up too.

But the bunnies panicked! "Oh no, we forgot the food" they cried looking at an empty plate! The bunnies went looking for Shanny, and called her when they could not find her in the house. Turns out, she already left to pick up food.
