# Bunny Snacks

Went to the grocery store this weekend as on typically does on Saturday. Had to be sure to get bunny snacks.

Cocoa and melon assured me fruits were bunny snacks. So I got a few.

The bunnies got really excited about the pineapple. Even offered to cut it.

Once the pineapple was cut up, they ran and got forks to fish out some bites.
