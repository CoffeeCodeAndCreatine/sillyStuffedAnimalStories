# New Hobbies

So here recently the bunnies have been pretty stressed out.
Between getting some land, full time bunny jobs, helping the humans, and trying to work side gigs to help espresso get his dream machine, itâ€™s been rough.

The bunnies, as you might have noticed took the week off. During there vacation, they explored some new hobbies.

Turns out bunnies like farming, houseplants, and ice?

In addition to plant farming the bunnies have also been exploring the art of ice farming and carving.
In order to make the ice though the bunnies went out and found a very small freezer.
